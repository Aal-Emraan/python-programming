there are 4 types of values can be added to a variable.
1. string ("hello", "1235") {string must have single qoutation or double)
2. intiger (1, 23, 6) {integers don't need any qoutation marks)
3. float (1.4, 2.5) (which mean a number with desimal)
4. boolean (True, False) (first latter must be capitalized)

# +, -, *, / is called operators.

// means how much time a number can go into another one.
exp: 17 // 5 = 3
!= means not equals.

Capitals matter in python. A capital latter and exact the same latter in lower case isn't same.
exp: Hello, hello, HELLO are not same!

four spaces in python is called indentation.

for x in range(a, b, c) here a is start, b is stop, c is step.
